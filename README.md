# Bento
Bento automatically tailors linters and static analysis with sane defaults on a per-project basis, letting you focus on writing code rather than configuring tools.

Bento supports JavaScript and Python, and is ideal for monorepos.

## Installation

Bento is supported on macOS Mojave (10.14) and Ubuntu 18.04+.
Bento requires Python version 3.6 or later and pip3.

### Installing Bento
Install Bento using:

```bash
pip3 install r2c-bento
```

## Usage

### Initialize Bento for a project:

In your project directory, run:

```bash
bento init
```

### Analyze your source code
To trigger Bento to analyze your project, run:

```bash
bento check
```

### Archive your 

The `archive` command whitelists outstanding issues to fix later. This lets you continue coding with a clean slate without having to address all your tech debt as soon as you adopt a new tool. New issues introduced from this point forward will be reported by Bento until the next time you run the `archive` command.

Archive issues by running:

```bash
bento archive
```

### Disable and enable individual checks
Enable/disable a specific check by running:

```bash
bento enable [OPTIONS] TOOL CHECK
```
or
```
bento disable [OPTIONS] TOOL CHECK
```
where:

* `TOOL` refers to the tool that includes the check, for example, `r2c.eslint`
*  `CHECK` refers to the label for the check you want to enable, for example `no-console`

You can find the tool and check names in the output of `bento check`. Bento currently supports the following tools:

| Language   | Supported Tools |
|------------|-----------------|
| Python     | bandit, flake8  |
| Javascript | eslint          |

If there are tools you'd like us to add, please let us know by creating an issue.

### Install Bento as a pre-commit hook
Bento can install itself as a pre-commit hook, so it runs before each commit and blocks on failures.

To install bento as a pre-commit hook, simply run:
```bash
bento install-hook
```
