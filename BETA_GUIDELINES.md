# Bento
Thanks for trying Bento.  
We ask that you follow these steps prior to the user interview.
 - Install Bento: `pip3 install bento-cli`
 - Initialize Bento: `bento init` (please provide your email when prompted)
 - Run Bento: `bento check`
 - Archive preexisting results: `bento archive`
 - Disable unwanted rules: `bento disable r2c.eslint arrow-parens`(this will disable the eslint arrow-parens rule)

## Notes
Bento doesn't do any style checking (whitespace, formatting, etc.) and also doesn't send any code off of your machine. You can read more about our privacy policy [here](https://github.com/returntocorp/bento/PRICACY.md).


More detailed installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/returntocorp/bento).  

To initialize Bento, choose a Python, Javascript, or TypeScript project that is managed by Git (Bento requires Git). 

During the initialization, when prompted, please enter the same email address you used for the interview so we can distinguish your session from other users.   

Once you run `bento check`, feel free to fix issues, ignore warnings, or disable specific checks (e.g., `bento disable r2c.eslint arrow-parens`). Just use Bento as many times as you'd like to use. ðŸ¤ž

We are curious if you'll like the `bento archive` feature as much as we do. This command will add all current findings to the archive (creating a .bento-whitelist.yml file). It provides a clean slate for your project, so you can keep coding. You can work through the imperfections in your project over time.
